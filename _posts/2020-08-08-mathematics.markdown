[Lagrange's four-square theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_four-square_theorem)

Lagrange's four-square theorem, also known as Bachet's conjecture, states that every natural number can be represented as the sum of four integer squares. That is, the squares form an additive basis of order four.

$$ p=a_{0}^{2}+a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+a_{3}^{2} $$

[Legendre's three-square theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_three-square_theorem)

Legendre's three-square theorem states that a natural number can be represented as the sum of three squares of integers

$$ n=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} $$

if and only if $$ n $$ is not of the form $$ n = 4^a(8b + 7) $$ for nonnegative integers $$ a $$ and $$ b $$.
