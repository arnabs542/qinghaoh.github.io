[Underscores in Numeric Literals][underscores-literals]

In Java SE 7 and later, any number of underscore characters (_) can appear anywhere between digits in a numerical literal. This feature enables you, for example, to separate groups of digits in numeric literals, which can improve the readability of your code.

{% highlight java %}
private static int MOD = 1_000_000_007
{% endhighlight %}

[Enhanced For][for]
The for statement also has another form designed for iteration through *Collections* and *arrays* This form is sometimes referred to as the enhanced for statement, and can be used to make your loops more compact and easy to read.

## Multidimensional Array
{% highlight java %}
int[][] matrix = new int[r][c];
// r == matrix.length
// c == matrix[0].length
{% endhighlight %}
