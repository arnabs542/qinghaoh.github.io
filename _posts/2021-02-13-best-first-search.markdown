# A\* Search

[A\* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) selects the path that minimizes

```f(n) = g(n) + h(n)```

where 
* `n` is the next node on the path
* `g(n)` is the cost of the path from the start node to `n`
* `h(n)` is a heuristic function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from `n` to the goal
  * problem-specific
  * admissible: it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal - A* is guaranteed to return a least-cost path
  * monotone/consistent: its estimate is always less than or equal to the estimated distance from any neighbouring vertex to the goal, plus the cost of reaching that neighbour - A* is guaranteed to find an optimal path without processing any node more than once and A* is equivalent to running Dijkstra's algorithm with the reduced cost `d'(x, y) = d(x, y) + h(y) âˆ’ h(x)`
